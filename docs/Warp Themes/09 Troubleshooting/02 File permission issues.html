<h1 class="title">File permission issues</h1>

<p class="article-lead">Learn, how to handle file permission issues with your Warp theme.</p>

<p>There are two ways of accessing files when working with Joomla or WordPress: either directly via your webserver or through an FTP client. Different files and directories have permissions specifying who can read, write or access them. Sometimes the permission settings of your webserver and your FTP client can collide, so that when trying to install an extension from the backend you are suddenly confronted with messages, like <em>JFolder::create: Could not create directory</em> or <em>Directory not writable: /administrator/templates/system/</em> or you may not be able to save theme settings.</p>

<h2>Change file permissions</h2>

<p>To resolve these issues, you need to change the permissions of the affected files or directories.</p>

<h3>Using your FTP client</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open your FTP client or, if you don't have any, download <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> and install it.</li>
  <li>Use your FTP client to login to your server and browse to your webroot directory.</li>
  <li>Right click on the directory on which you want to change the permissions and click <em>File Permissions...</em></li>
  <li>The <em>Change File Attributes</em> dialog lets you check different options or type in a numeric value like <em>755</em>. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="badge badge-danger">IMPORTANT</span> Always avoid <em>777</em> permissions. If your webserver has problems with the CHMOD <em>755</em>, you can also try <em>775</em> and lastly <em>777</em> in this order.</p>

<h3>Use a Joomla extension to access your webserver</h3>

<p>Using an FTP client may also change file ownership to the FTP user of the files or directories you changed the permissions on. This may cause problems on some webservers. To avoid this, you can use a Joomla component like <em>eXtplorer</em> to update the permission through the Joomla administration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the Joomla component <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/file-management/2630">eXtplorer</a> and install it. It allows you to edit, delete, copy, rename, archive and unpack files and directories directly on your webserver.</li>
  <li>Login to your Joomla administration, go to the eXtplorer component and browse to the directory on which you want to change the permissions.</li>
  <li>Right click on the directory and choose <em>Change Rights</em>.</li>
  <li>Check the options as shown below. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit the Save button.</li>
</ol>
