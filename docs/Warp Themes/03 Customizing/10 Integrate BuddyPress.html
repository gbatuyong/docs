<h1 class="title">Integrate BuddyPress</h1>

<p>
    Our themes can easily be used with the popular WordPress Plugin
    <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a>. To combine these two in
     a beautiful manner and adjust the default look to your own needs you just
     have to follow these easy steps.
 </p>

<h2>Install BuddyPress</h2>

<p class="clearfix">
    In your WordPress backend, go to your plugin section, search for <em>BuddyPress</em>
    and install it. After activation of the plugin you have to go through some setup steps.
</p>

<p class="clearfix">
    In the last setup step you are asked to install the <em>BuddyPress template pack</em>. This is
    essential, so please install it as well.
</p>

<h2>BuddyPress Compatibility Setup</h2>

    After finishing the installation a notification will pop up in the administration
    area. A click on the <em>BP compatibility</em> link leads you to a simple process that copies
    some BuddyPress files in your theme directory.

    All steps should work by simply clicking the according <em>Continue</em> button. For
    detailed information on this process please have a look at the official <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/theme-development/wordpress-to-buddypress-theme/">BuddyPress guide</a>.
</p>

<h2>Make your own adjustments</h2>

<p>
    BuddyPress is now installed and ready to be used in your theme. Depending on the installed BuddyPress version
    and your chosen theme you might still have some visual adjustment work to do.
    Since you would like your social community to be unique you may want to change a lot of the default
    styling anyway. Experience shows that the default BuddyPress style works best with
    bright variations of one of our themes.
</p>

<p>
    As a start we have prepared some <em>CSS</em> for you that applies some <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em>
    and <em>float</em> corrections to the default BuddyPress styles. This can be put in your theme's <em>css/extensions.css</em>.
    However, for update safety we always recommend {doc: create-a-new-style text: creating your own style}.
