<h1 class="title">Create language files</h1>

<p>This tutorial shows you how to translate a Warp based theme. Let's say we want a site with Russian as the frontend language. To add the Russian language support to our template just follow the steps for the different systems.</p>

<h2>Joomla</h2>

<p>Go to the directory <em>/warp/systems/joomla/language</em>. Copy the directory en-GB and rename it to ru-RU. Do the same with the .ini files in the directory. That's it, now you only need to translate the content of ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini to your language.</p>

<p>Here is a short example of how the translatable language strings are used in the Joomla templates. <em>TPL_WARP_EXAMPLE</em> is the language variable:</p>

<pre><code>JText::_('TPL_WARP_EXAMPLE')
</code></pre>

<h2>WordPress</h2>

<p>Go to the directory <em>/languages</em> of your theme. Copy the file en_US.po and rename it to ru_RU.po. Now you can translate the .po file and any strings located within it to your language using <a href="http://www.poedit.net">Poedit</a> and compile it to ru_RU.mo. For further instructions please take a look a the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress">Translating WordPress</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>Here is a short example of how the translatable language strings are used in the WordPress themes. <em>Example Text</em> is the string and <em>warp</em> is the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#Choosing_and_loading_a_domain">text domain</a>:</p>

<pre><code>('Example text', 'warp')
</code></pre>
