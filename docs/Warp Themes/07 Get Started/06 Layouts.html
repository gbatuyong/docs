<h1 class="title">Layout Settings</h1>

<p class="article-lead">The layout settings manage the positioning of different layout parts.</p>

<p>This section makes the arrangement of your content very easy and flexible. You can enable or disable system output, define the layout of the theme's widget or module positions and select a style you created in the customizer. Additionally you have the possibility to store your modifications in a layout profile and assign it to different pages.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>
<p>This option enables you to <em>assign a style</em> to your layout. In addition with the {doc: customizer text: customizer} and the layout manager this makes styling your pages very flexible.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This option allows you to hide the <em>main system output</em>. This is useful, if you want to position only widgets/modules on certain pages, without leaving redundant space.</p>

<h2>Sidebars</h2>
<p>The Warp framework provides the following layout options for the sidebars.</p>

<table class="zebra">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Width</em></td>
    <td>Choose from the provided percent values to set the sidebar width.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Alignment</em></td>
    <td>Define, whether the sidebar is published on the left or right side of the content.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The sidebar settings allow you to create a fully functional multi-column layout. The only requirement is to publish a widget or module on a sidebar position to display the selected alignment.</p>

<h2>Grid</h2>
<p>This table gives you an overview of the grid layout settings.</p>

<table class="zebra">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Layout</em></td>
    <td>Define, whether the widgets or modules are positioned side-by-side, stacked vertically or first doubled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Responsive</em></td>
    <td>Define, on which devices the widgets or modules take up full width and stack vertically.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><em>Divider</em></td>
    <td>Add a vertical divider between parallel or first doubled widgets/modules to separate them from each other.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For more information on widgets and modules, take a look at the {doc: widgets-2 text: Widgets/Modules} tutorial.</p>
