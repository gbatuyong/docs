    <tr>
      <td><em>Width</em></td>  
      <td>Enter a pixel value to set the width of the dropdown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Icon</em></td>  
      <td>Choose an icon from the icon preview within the select box to assign it to a menu item or even a sub item. You can also use a custom image. Enter the full path in Joomla, for example <code>/images/MY-IMAGE.jpg</code>. WordPress already looks into the <code>/wp-content/uploads</code> folder. So you only need to enter your custom path, for example <code>MY-IMAGE.jpg</code>.</td>
