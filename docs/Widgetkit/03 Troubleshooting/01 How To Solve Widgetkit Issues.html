	<p>If you are having trouble or issues with Widgetkit, this can have numerous causes. First of all, take a look at our built-in system check in the Widgetkit administration. It helps you to detect and determine common issues. Should the system check find any issues, the alert box will automatically appear in your Widgetkit admin area.</p>
	
	<p>Here are some more commen issues that might arise:</p>

<h2>Widgetkit Administration is unstyled</h2>

<p>This is caused by Javascript conflict in the adminstration area. Most likely another jQuery library is loaded by a 3rd party extension or plugin. Please read {doc: javascript-errors-2 text: this tutorial} on how to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>Javascript Effects stop working</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with Javascript effects, this might be due to a jQuery conflict. Please read {doc: javascript-errors-2 text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>No gallery images being loaded</h2>

<p>This might be due to permission issues. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues-2 text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="blank-page">Blank Page</h2>

<p>This is most likely due to a php error being thrown. Please enable the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors parameter</a> in your php.ini. Only with an error message the problem can be found.</p>

<p>Another way to check for PHP errors, is to have a look at your PHP error log. The PHP log shows information on errors and warnings thrown by PHP. Your host should have configured PHP to write that information to a log rather than output them on screen.</p>
